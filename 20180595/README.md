I looked at many of the official documentation for each of the libraries I used: Mobx, Nextjs, Animejs, react-animejs-wrapper, Reactjs, MaterialUI, mongodb, mongoose.
I also saw many Q&As in Stack Overflow, which are too numerous to list but I didn't copy & paste code from there.
I incorporated some boilerplate code from [create-next-app with mobx-react-lite](https://github.com/umarmw/nextjs-with-mobx-lite).
I also looked at [mobx + react example project](https://byseop.netlify.app/mobx-tutorial01/) for examples about Mobx being used with Axios.
